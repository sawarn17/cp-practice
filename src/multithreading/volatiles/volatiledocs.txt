2. Shared Multiprocessor Architecture
   - Processors are responsible for executing program instructions. 
        Therefore, they must retrieve the program instructions and required data from RAM.
   - As CPUs can carry many instructions per second, fetching from RAM isnâ€™t ideal for them. To improve this situation, 
        processors use tricks like Out of Order Execution, Branch Prediction, Speculative Execution, and Caching.
   
Computer Core Memory Works like:

            Core 1. L1 Cache(Data Cahe + instructions cache)
                    L2 Cache
                    L3 Cache

                    Bus 
                    RAM
