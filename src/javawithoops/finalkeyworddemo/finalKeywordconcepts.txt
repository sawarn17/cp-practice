1.1 Final Applied on Class Level Behavior:

- When we want to set the limit on extensibility of a class then we are using final keyword.
    Final Class can't be inherited.
    eg: String class

  In genrally every class can extends Objects class of the java.

  ** Note that the final keyword in a class declaration doesnâ€™t mean that the objects of this class are immutable. 
     We can change the fields of that final object class freely:



1.2 Final Applied on Method level Behavior
- The method marked as final could not be ovverriden.



1.3 Final Variable: 
    When we make a final Variable then values can't be reassigned.
    Once Value can be assigned then it can't be reassigned.

1.4 Final Refence Variable also not be immutable.


Notes : 
- Final feilds sould be a constants, or write once feilds.
- It is not a part of Objects so that it can't be takes parts in serilization
- It just used like a constant Variable.
- As per naming convention it should be in UPPER Case Letter followed by UNDERSCORE _
    Eg : public final int AGE_CONSTANT =18;
