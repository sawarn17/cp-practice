	 * HashMap Tutriol
	 * It is used to store the key value pairs
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Benifits of useing it
	 * very high performance || finding elements takes O(n) || if list is sorted then O(log n)
	 * Time complexity to insert and retrieve a value is O(1)
	 * It uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array
	 * Single null key insertion possible || Multiple null value insetion possible
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Disadvantag
	 * Since HashMaps use an underlying array, they can use more memory than other data structures like arrays or lists.
	 * HashMaps can be more complex to understand and use than simple arrays or lists
	 * In some cases, if the hashing function is not properly implemented or if the load factor is too high, the performance of a HashMap can degrade.
	 * Thread unsafe
	 *
